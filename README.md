Phishing Rod is a tool which can be used for Phishing Attacks, for now it can only be used for gmail but i am working on other platforms also.
To use it follow these instructions:
    1. Use this command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the requirments.
    2. Create an account for ngrok and get the authtoken and paste it in "ngrok/authtoken.txt" file.
    3. As this script will redirect the victim to the specified site after finishing the attack you can just paste url of that site in "site/url.txt" and after finshing the attack it will just redirect him/her to that site to make it more promising default site is "https://www.google.com".
    4. Open the terminal in the folder and run this command "python server.py".
    5. It will give you the public url which you can send to your victim.
    6. His/Her Email, His/Her Password and his/her IP Address will be saved in "user_data.txt" file.
